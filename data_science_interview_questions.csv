What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data for training, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns."
What is overfitting in machine learning?,Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data due to excessive complexity.
How do you handle missing data in a dataset?,"Missing data can be handled using techniques like mean/mode/median imputation, removing rows, or using algorithms that handle missing data."
Explain the concept of cross-validation.,Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate the generalization ability of a model by splitting the data into multiple training and testing sets.
What is the bias-variance tradeoff?,The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's accuracy on training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new data (low variance).
What are precision and recall?,"Precision is the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives."
What is a confusion matrix?,A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing actual and predicted labels.
What is gradient descent?,Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent.
Explain the concept of regularization.,Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function for large coefficients in the model.
What is a random forest?,A random forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.
